<h2> <b> Photostudioroom - Appointment Booking For Photoshoot &amp; Stock Images </b> </h2>

I Made This Project in Python's <b> Django </b> Framework, For Database I Have Used <b> MySQL </b> and It is in The Development Server. <br>

<b> Photostudioroom </b> is The Name Of This Website, <br>
There Are <b> Two </b>Facilities In My Website/Project, <br>
First is <b> Appointment Booking For Photoshoot </b> and Second is <b> Stock Images </b> Where Customer Can Purchase Images and Contributor Can Upload Images. <br>

<b> Appointment Booking:  </b>
If Anyone Wants to Do a Photoshoot Then They Have to Go to a Studio and Wait For Their Turn,
So It is Time Consuming and Expensive,

So By Using This Website Users Have to Register Themselves and Fill an Appointment Form,
Users Have to Fill Details Like Photos Quantity, Date & Time of Appointment,Contact Number etc.

After Filling Form Users Will be Displayed an Estimated Amount According To Photos Quantity and Other Details,
After This Users Have to Pay Some Amount As Booking Amount(I Haven't Included Payment Gateway, I Have Created a Fake Page For Demo),
And That's All Customer Can Visit Studio On Selected Date & Time,

For Photoshoot I Have Also Selected Some Events Like Baby Shower,Pre-Wedding,Wedding Etc,
So You Can Also Call Photographers To Your Preferred Place For a Photoshoot.

<b> Stock Images: </b>
Stock Images is Not a New Thing, <br>
Here You Can Register as a Customer or as a Contributor,

<u> Customer: </u> Can View Watermarked Images, Like Them, Purchase Them and Download Them Without Watermark After Purchase.
<u> Contributor: </u> Can Upload Images, If Approved By The Admin Then They Can Earn Money If Their Image Made Money On The Website, Can Also View Analytics Of Their Images.

So The Concept is Simple, Contributors Will Upload Images, If Admin Approves Then The Images Will Go Live On The Website,
Then Customers Can Purchase Images and Then The Contributors Will Earn Money.
